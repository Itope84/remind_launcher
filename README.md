# remind_launcher

An android launcher app, built with flutter with an home screen that shows you a list of important things you want to remember.

## The Story

I always wanted to build a mobile app to keep track of my goals and project ideas and to remind me every once in a while to pick up one of the projects if I'm less busy. The only problem is, if you only remind me every once in a while, that doesn't suit me, I'll just ignore the reminder. Also, what about things like reminding me to "trek to work", "don't take drinks" etc. I need to see those reminders while I'm on my way to work, or to the supermarket, in short, every time I look at my phone.

The solution? A launcher app, whose home screen shows all the important things you want to remember! This launcher is fairly simple for now. You can add tasks or mark tasks as done, all from the homepage.
